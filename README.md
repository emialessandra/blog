# Editorial App Starter: Vanilla JS app that uses Strapi

This is an editorial starter app built with Vanilla JS. It's meant to display articles returned from a [Strapi](strapi.io) server. However, it is incomplete and just serves as a starting point. This codebase is meant to accompany [this article]() detailing how to use [Strapi](strapi.io) with vanilla JavaScript apps.

This is a starter. So you need to add the JavaScript code outlined in the tutorial to get it to  work as expected.

Before attempting to run this app, make sure your local instance of Strapi is running at http://localhost:1337 and that all the missing script code is added to the files in the `./scripts/` folder. 

Then run the app with:
```
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
